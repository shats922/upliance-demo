Component structure:

1. Created 4 individual components as per functionality 

2. Counter, Rich text editor, User form and User list

3. The parent App maintains the state and passes to children for read and update

State management: We are using local storage to persist data across page reloads, and useState while the app is running, which stores in ram 

useEffect is used to store data in storage whenever state is modified by user action
